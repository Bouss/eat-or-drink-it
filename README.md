# Academic project

Project created in 2016 by three french students from the university of Nantes as part of our "DWAR" (in english, Web Development and Rich Internet Applications) unit.

The aim of the application is a quizz about food, and more exactly the "AOC" products (in english, Controlled Designation of Origin).
For each AOC (5 random AOCs a game), players have to answer the question "Is it food or drink ?" and put the geographic origin on a map.
