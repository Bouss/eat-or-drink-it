# Academic project

Project created by three french students from the university of Nantes as part of our "DWAR" (in english, Web Development and Rich Internet Applications) unit.

The aim of the application is a quizz about food, and more exactly the "AOC" products (in english, Controlled Designation of Origin).
Users have to choose the geographic origin of AOC products, and if realisable, guess if it's food/drink.

The project is written in Java EE/Angular JS and uses open data.
