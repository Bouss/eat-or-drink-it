# Academic project

Project created by three french students from the university of Nantes as part of our "DWAR" (in english, Web Development and Rich Internet Applications) unit.

The aim of the application is a quizz about food, and more exactly the "AOC" products (in english, Controlled Designation of Origin).
For each AOC, players have to answer it's food/drink and put the geographic origin on a map.

The project is written in Java EE/AngularJS and uses open data.

Here are the open data : https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/aires-geographiques-des-aoc-aop/
